# Tennies_Game_Development
A 2D tennis game developed using Python's Turtle graphics. Players control movement with keyboard keys, while the ball bounces with basic physics. The game tracks scores, detects collisions, and displays a winner with sound effects. A beginner-friendly project to explore Python graphics, game logic, and interactivity.

This project is a simple yet engaging 2D tennis game coded in Python using Turtle graphics. Two players (left and right) can be controlled via keyboard keys (WASD and arrow keys). The game includes ball movement, collision detection, score updates, and game over condition with winner declaration. A sound effect is played upon game completion. Ideal for beginners learning about animation, graphics, and game logic in Python.
