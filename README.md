# Tennies_Game_Development
A 2D tennis game developed using Python's Turtle graphics. Players control movement with keyboard keys, while the ball bounces with basic physics. The game tracks scores, detects collisions, and displays a winner with sound effects. A beginner-friendly project to explore Python graphics, game logic, and interactivity.
